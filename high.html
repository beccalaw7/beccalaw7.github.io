                  <p>
                    These are high wispy bands of ice crystals which can appear in straight lines or can have a feather-like appearance to them. The ice crystals are in a lower concentration than water droplets in lower clouds which means it can look as if they are diffusing and may form virga.

                  <p>
                  These clouds have long been used as weather warnings by sailors because if they begin to spread out horizontally and thicken then bad weather is on its way. This can be seen as a good thing because it actually means a warm front is on its way, but as it pushes moist air ahead of it, rain is imminent. You may have heard of mare’s tails or mackerel skies making tall ships carry low sails and it is the mare’s tails that are associated with cirrus uncinus.

                    When a warm front is on its way the air becomes noticeably warmer and more humid which means there is a higher concentration of water vapour in it that can condense when it reaches the dew point. The dew point rises when a warm front is on its way so you get a lot of high cirrus clouds forming because this is the point at which condensation happens. Sometimes sublimation occurs which is where water vapour in the gas state goes straight into solid state ice crystals and completely misses out the liquid droplet stage. This is due to the extremely cold temperatures up at 6km (20,000ft) which are around -40°C to -50°C so there is no time for the water vapour to condense into liquid state before freezing.

                    Cirrus uncinus can form from breaking up cirrocumulus or cirrostratus clouds which were clumped together but began to diffuse and sink due to strong winds in the upper troposphere and a reduction in moisture reaching them. Mare’s tails form when some of the early forming crystals in the main body of cirrus uncinus grow and become heavier than the newly forming crystals around them so they sink. As they sink they are blown by the wind which creates the wispy hooked tails that are all so unique and beautiful. If you see large parallel bands of cirrus then they are almost certainly associated with the jet stream which is a strong current of air blowing in the same direction over large areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Cirrus clouds will often appear to be the brightest, whitest clouds in the sky and this is because they are closest to the sun and will always be illuminated by the sun’s rays. This is seen best at sunset when all of the lower clouds in the sky are in shadow but the cirrus clouds are still being illuminated by the sun.

                      <p>
                        The Spissatus type reside high in the sky but tend to dominate and cover large areas of sky in thick, dense patches. Castellanus have turret-like sproutings and Floccus have cumuliform tufts, both with ragged edges. They can create amazing displays of trailing tendrils when some of the ice crystals become so large that they sink and are affected by a stable cool air flow causing them to spread out for large distances.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If these clouds are seen to thicken and spread out it is a warning of stormy weather to come in the next 48 hours. They are technically precipitating clouds because of the falling ice crystals (snow/rain) forming virga trails, but they evaporate before reaching the ground.

                    <p>
                    This rather long named cirrus cloud forms from the leftover anvil on a Cumulonimbus cloud. The anvil is a turbulent patch of cirrus cloud that forms above a storm cloud and spreads out horizontally to create the anvil shape. When the Cumulonimbus cloud has finished raining and its energy begins to dissipate, the anvil can begin to drift away from the main body of the cloud via strong winds in the upper troposphere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If these clouds thicken and spread out then it could be a sign of more rain to come in the next 24-48 hours, but it is overall quite difficult to tell from these clouds alone so consider acknowledging the other clouds present in the sky.

                    <p>
                      You might notice that these clouds appear to be similar to the CH1 type, but the difference is that CH4 will progressively invade the sky. They come together and can create some stunning rippled formations, thinning out to form large cirrostratus patches in the sky. This is because of an incoming warm front that brings with it lots of warm, moist air that rises over areas of cold air so that cirrus clouds form at high altitudes of around 6km (20,000ft).

                      You may have noticed a pattern emerging with cirrus clouds in that if they are seen to thicken or spread out it is a sure sign of an approaching period of low pressure and imminent bad weather. However, while the sun is still shining you may see some rare optical phenomena such as mock sun dogs, circumzenthial arcs and haloes.

                    <p>
                    When air in the troposphere slowly rises and reaches a high dew point, the water vapour will sublime into ice crystals due to the extremely low temperatures at this altitude. They form sheets of cirrostratus which are essentially white-grey blankets of cloud in the upper troposphere that will progressively invade the sky but will never reach 45° above the horizon.

                    If the expanse formed from a CH4 cloud spreading and thickening then it is a sure sign that wet weather will be on its way within the next 48 hours. However, if it forms cirrocumulus clouds (CH9) then you will probably experience dry weather for at least another day or two.

                    <p>
                    This cloud is very similar to CH5 but will tend to change continuously and spread to cover more than 45° above the horizon, but not all of the sky has to be covered. Often CH5 will soon become CH6 and will then display less clear cut edges and some fibrous structures as well.

                    <p>
                    The weather implications for this cloud are very much the same as CH5 so keep an eye on it thickening and spreading because it cannot produce precipitation itself but may be a sign of bad weather to come.

                    The sky will be covered by a veil of cirrostratus clouds that vary from dense patches to more fibrous and thin patches that allow the sunlight through. Often the sunlight is diffused through this cloud and you can see a halo around the sun/moon.

                    This cloud usually begins with the formation of Cirrus Uncinus (CH1) which thickens and spreads into CH7. However, often CH7 can thicken further and descend into Altostratus (CM1) which can sometimes lead to Nimbostratus (CM2) bringing rainy weather.

                      Haloes form when lots of hexagonal ice crystals in a veil of cirrostratus cloud reflect and refract incoming light and split it into the rainbow colours, much like a prism does. They occur around the sun or moon in a 22° radius circle which makes them much larger than a corona which was associated with CM1 clouds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Refraction is the bending of a ray of light when it passes through a medium which changes the velocity that it was travelling at; its frequency remains constant, but its wavelength will adjust accordingly. If light goes from a fast medium (air) to a slow medium (glass) the ray will bend towards the normal to the boundary between the two materials. Snell’s Law shows the relationship between the Index of Refraction and the sin of the angle of incidence and the sin of the angle of refraction. The amount of bending is dependent on the Index of Refraction which is defined as the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the speed of light in the medium.

                    <p>
                      This is a patch of cirrostratus cloud that no longer covers or invades the entire sky and can have very clear edges or broken, ragged ones. It can sometimes look like a broken patch of cirrus fibratus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If this cloud remains unchanged then it reflects stable conditions to follow, but as always if it begins to spread and thicken then it is likely you will experience a change in the conditions. These clouds have a tendency to be rather long lived.

                    <p>
                      This rare cloud species usually appear very high, 5km-14km (16,000ft-45,000ft) in the sky in rippled white patches. You may have heard some of the patterns referred to as mackerel skies or herringbone formations which are very short lived due to the conditions in which they form. You can easily tell the difference between a cirrocumulus (high) and an altocumulus (medium) because if you hold your arm up to the sky one cirrocumulus cloudlet will be the size of just one finger whereas altocumulus will be the width of two or three fingers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Sometimes cirrocumulus will spread out to form a veil of cirrostratus but usually the broken up nature of these formations show how turbulent the conditions are up there. We all know that mackerel skies bring bad weather so keep an eye on it because these clouds indicate a large amount of moisture high in the sky; from an incoming depression pushing it up there!

                      Cirrocumulus Stratiformis form when there is a good amount of upward convection of heat reaching the upper troposphere due to gentle winds below. This forms the cumuliform shaped clouds which are separated by rifts (gaps) in a uniform pattern because of the turbulence they experience once they have formed up there. These can sometimes sink to become CM5 clouds which are much larger or they can join up with other patches in the sky to create massive formations which can be very breath-taking. In hilly areas you can see the smoother looking Cirrocumulus Lenticularis clouds which form in the same way as described in CM4 but at a higher altitude.
