                  <p>
                  This cloud covers most of the sky in a thin, grey, featureless blanket. It can form from a sinking CH5 cloud or from a Cumulonimbus cloud spreading out at the top. Optical phenomena known as coronas and irisation are associated with these clouds because of the uniform droplets being perfect for the suns (or moons) light to diffract around them, creating coloured rings or patches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They are often associated with overcast skies, however, these clouds are a sign of an incoming warm front because they can result from the lifting of a warm air mass that comes ahead of a warm front. Unfortunately, if the warm air continues to push in, you will get rain soon (transition to CM2) because of the moisture being forced upwards.

                      <p>
                        As a CM1 cloud thickens and obscures the sun/moon more, it transitions to an Altostratus Opacus cloud; so it is still uniform and grey. If this thickens even more and begins to rain then it becomes a Nimbostratus cloud because ‘nimbo’ is Latin for rain bearing. This cloud doesn’t technically have a place in the sky because it can occur at any altitude, but it is classified here as CM2 just for the purposes of organising the clouds.

                  This cloud is probably everyone’s least favourite because it is the thick, gloomy, rain bearing blanket that just keeps raining all day. On the other hand, it can also produce snow/sleet which means you can go and build a snowman!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I took the photos on the right on a day where I could see some rain on its way so I took them with a few minutes between to show the transition from a clearer brighter looking sky (1) to a blurry raining sky (4).

                      These are rounded cotton-wool clumps that appear at medium-level in a uniform arrangement, composed of supercooled water droplets or ice crystals. However, Altocumulus clouds are so varied that they occupy 7 of the 27 catagories in the sky!

                      If these clouds remain unchanged they suggest stable weather conditions, but, if they start to thicken and form a frosted appearance then you should expect rain in the next 24 hours. Overall, if you see these clouds they look spectacular, but indicate changing conditions usually from good to bad!

                      These clouds are convective clouds which require the sun to heat the ground and allow the warm air just above to rise. Gentle ground winds usher moist air upwards, allowing it to rise beyond the usual height for low clouds to form such as the Cumulonimbus bases. When the water vapour reaches higher altitudes, 2-6 km (6000-20,000 ft), where medium clouds form they encounter strong cross winds which force the condensation process to happen and create uniform puffs of clouds. There are several types of Altocumulus clouds that could form, but they depend on the different cross winds that are blowing and their direction; often one current is driving against the other.

                      These clouds look like smooth and layered discs because a flowing layer of moist air was forced over a hill/mountain and so they are very localised phenomena. Sometimes they have been mistaken for UFO’s and been reported to the police! Others look like a large stack and have the French name ‘pile d’assiettes’ which means stack of plates.

                    <p>
                      These clouds are only local and specific to the orographic location so they will indicate a stability in conditions if they remain unchanged. If they do begin to spread out or thicken then you could expect some different conditions in the next few hours.

                      As stable air flows over land it encounters obstacles which can either be manmade, like tall buildings, or natural, like mountains. They create turbulent eddies where the air flow has been disturbed on the lee side of the obstruction, and it is classified as ‘mechanical’ turbulence because it involves mechanical disruption of the ambient air flow. The moist air creates a series of large scale standing waves on the lee side of the mountain (obstruction), which in physics we define as stationary waves that are the result of the superposition of two waves with the same amplitude, speed and frequency, but in opposite directions. Lenticular clouds form at the crests of these waves where the temperature reaches the dew point in which condensation occurs.

                    <p>
                      These clouds are the most common clouds on Earth and look like a blanket of cumulus clouds stretched across the sky and slightly broken up into clumps. They form when low sheets of stratus clouds break up due to upward convection and form thicker, darker rolls of clouds. Some parts of the clouds can form convective turrets in which case they would be stratocumulus castellanus clouds that could develop into CL2 clouds. Stratocumulus Lenticularis are a rare form of cloud that form when warm air is forced over hills and create long lenticular shapes. Stratocumulus stratiformis are a less continuous form of this cloud and blue sky can be seen between the small cotton wool clumps.

                    <p>
                      These clouds are deceitful in that they look like they are threatening heavy rain but they do in fact need to grow a lot taller and darker for that to occur so the most they have to offer is a bit of light drizzle.

                    This is a very low level cloud that can obscure the tops of buildings with its large continuous sheet of water droplets in a uniform grey blanket. They form in cool, stable conditions and don’t rely on convection to form, like cumulus clouds do. They form when a cool air mass is blown over the cold sea or land which causes widespread low-level condensation (<500m).

                    <p>
                      If this cloud is lifting over hills then you could be expecting some rain to follow. However, if it has formed overnight and seems dull on your summer’s morning, often the sun will evaporate the droplets away leaving you with a lovely sunny day.

                      This is not a cloud to confuse with fog or mist because some would argue that these are not strictly clouds at all because of their direct contact with the surface and formation from the surface. There is a distinct difference between fog and mist which is useful to know and it is hidden in their definitions; FOG: 'Obscurity in the surface layers of the atmosphere, which is caused by a suspension of water droplets resulting visibility less than 1 km' MIST: 'when there is such obscurity and the associated visibility is equal to or exceeds 1 km'. This means that mist is a less dense version of fog and you can see further in it as only the slightest winds can clear it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Technically fog is just a cloud that formed at ground level because they share the same properties. Radiation fog is common on clear stable winter nights when the ground cools down and the air above the ground cools too. This causes the air to reach its dew point because it becomes cooled to a point where it cannot hold any more moisture so it condenses out to form fog. This type of fog often clears quickly when the sun heats the ground and evaporates the droplets away.

                    <h3>Cumulus and Stratocumulus at different heights (CL8):</h3>
                    <p>
                      These are small, convective clouds that form about 300m (1000ft) beneath an already present stratocumulus layer at 900m (3000ft) and instead of spreading horizontally as before, they thrust through the layer. As this happens the upper stratocumulus layer can begin to break up due to the contact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The lower layer of cumulus clouds is unlikely to produce any rain but if the upper stratocumulus layer thickens and becomes darker then you could expect rain soon. These are clouds to keep an eye on because of the sheer uncertainty around them.

                    <p>
                      There is a reason that to feel on top of the world is called being on cloud nine, and that is because the almighty Cumulonimbus (CL9) cloud can stretch from around 600m (2000ft) to 18km (60,000ft) or more which is where the troposphere meets the stratosphere, making them the tallest structures on (sort of) Earth. They are very powerful thunderclouds that contain as much energy as ten Hiroshima-sized atom bombs and can be recognised by their towering cauliflower bulges and ice crystal anvil top from the strong convection currents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Single cell cumulonimbus clouds will produce short lived (1 hour) heavy rain, thunder, lightning, hail and strong winds. Multiple cells can coalesce and form giant structures that precipitate for hours/days and these storm systems are responsible for tornadoes too.

                      Cumulonimbus clouds form when there are strong convective currents and updraughts of thermals that allow the cloud to grow in size and energy as more is released through condensation. Lightning is one of the most exciting phenomena to come from these clouds and it begins with polarisation; the separation of opposite charges. The powerful updraughts of air cause collisions of water droplets which separate electrons from their proton-neutron nucleus leading to an excess of positive charges congregating at the top of the cloud and an excess of negative charges near the base of the cloud. Another mechanism that causes polarisation to occur is through freezing. Droplets freeze within the cloud when they reach a certain height and the temperature cools to around -30°C and they become negatively charged. These are then surrounded by positively charged water droplets that haven’t yet been frozen but can be easily moved with updraughts because they are less dense. Therefore the positive droplets get carried to the top of the cloud and the negatively charged ice droplets sink to the bottom. As you can imagine, this mechanism is continuous and droplets are always moving around within the cloud; this is the same mechanism that forms hail stones.

                    <p>
                      A movement of electrons to Earth’s surface is induced by the cloud’s electric field and electrons on the Earth’s outer surface are repelled by the negatively charged cloud base which creates a positive charge on Earth’s surface below the cloud. This is a build-up of static charge which increases as the electric field increases and eventually a cluster of electrons want to be discharged from the cloud base. The air is an insulator under normal conditions but the electric fields of the cloud are capable of ionising the air around it and so the air becomes a conductive plasma of free electrons and positive ions. This allows the cluster of electrons to zig-zag down to Earth via the conductive plasma at around 60 miles per second (very very fast). This cluster isn’t the actual lightning strike, but the step leader which begins the journey to the earth due to the conductive plasma and the clouds electric field. A purple glow is seen here from the ionised air molecules.

                      The lightning bolt follows when the positive charge builds up more on the Earth’s surface from further movement of electrons and the formation of a streamer as the positive charge migrates upwards to meet the step leader. On meeting, they complete the path for lightning which is a surge of electrons that travel at 50,000 miles per second (very very very very very fast). The flash we observe is from the return stroke that is a surge of electrons racing upwards to the cloud. The lightning strike heats the air to 30,000°C which generates a shockwave, through the rapid expansion of air, which we hear as thunder.
