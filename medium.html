                  This cloud covers most of the sky in a thin, grey, featureless blanket. It can form from a sinking CH5 cloud or from a Cumulonimbus cloud spreading out at the top. Optical phenomena known as coronas and irisation are associated with these clouds because of the uniform droplets being perfect for the suns (or moons) light to diffract around them, creating coloured rings or patches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They are often associated with overcast skies, however, these clouds are a sign of an incoming warm front because they can result from the lifting of a warm air mass that comes ahead of a warm front. Unfortunately, if the warm air continues to push in, you will get rain soon (transition to CM2) because of the moisture being forced upwards.

                      <p>
                        As a CM1 cloud thickens and obscures the sun/moon more, it transitions to an Altostratus Opacus cloud; so it is still uniform and grey. If this thickens even more and begins to rain then it becomes a Nimbostratus cloud because ‘nimbo’ is Latin for rain bearing. This cloud doesn’t technically have a place in the sky because it can occur at any altitude, but it is classified here as CM2 just for the purposes of organising the clouds.

                  This cloud is probably everyone’s least favourite because it is the thick, gloomy, rain bearing blanket that just keeps raining all day. On the other hand, it can also produce snow/sleet which means you can go and build a snowman!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I took the photos on the right on a day where I could see some rain on its way so I took them with a few minutes between to show the transition from a clearer brighter looking sky (1) to a blurry raining sky (4).

                      These are rounded cotton-wool clumps that appear at medium-level in a uniform arrangement, composed of supercooled water droplets or ice crystals. However, Altocumulus clouds are so varied that they occupy 7 of the 27 catagories in the sky!

                      If these clouds remain unchanged they suggest stable weather conditions, but, if they start to thicken and form a frosted appearance then you should expect rain in the next 24 hours. Overall, if you see these clouds they look spectacular, but indicate changing conditions usually from good to bad!

                      These clouds are convective clouds which require the sun to heat the ground and allow the warm air just above to rise. Gentle ground winds usher moist air upwards, allowing it to rise beyond the usual height for low clouds to form such as the Cumulonimbus bases. When the water vapour reaches higher altitudes, 2-6 km (6000-20,000 ft), where medium clouds form they encounter strong cross winds which force the condensation process to happen and create uniform puffs of clouds. There are several types of Altocumulus clouds that could form, but they depend on the different cross winds that are blowing and their direction; often one current is driving against the other.

                      These clouds look like smooth and layered discs because a flowing layer of moist air was forced over a hill/mountain and so they are very localised phenomena. Sometimes they have been mistaken for UFO’s and been reported to the police! Others look like a large stack and have the French name ‘pile d’assiettes’ which means stack of plates.

                    <p>
                      These clouds are only local and specific to the orographic location so they will indicate a stability in conditions if they remain unchanged. If they do begin to spread out or thicken then you could expect some different conditions in the next few hours.

                      This is a cloud I have not had the oppurtunity to see properly so I have found an example of a Lenticularis cloud from The Cloud Appreciation Society's Gallery: ‘Piling up’, Corsica. &copy; Roel van der Vegte. Posted on August 10, 2011.

                      As stable air flows over land it encounters obstacles which can either be manmade, like tall buildings, or natural, like mountains. They create turbulent eddies where the air flow has been disturbed on the lee side of the obstruction, and it is classified as ‘mechanical’ turbulence because it involves mechanical disruption of the ambient air flow. The moist air creates a series of large scale standing waves on the lee side of the mountain (obstruction), which in physics we define as stationary waves that are the result of the superposition of two waves with the same amplitude, speed and frequency, but in opposite directions. Lenticular clouds form at the crests of these waves where the temperature reaches the dew point in which condensation occurs.

                    <p>
                      These clouds appear to be similar to CM3 but the difference is that CM5 will progressively invade the sky whilst CM3 remain in static localised patches. They look like semi-transparent bands of arranged cotton wool puffs that can occur in one or more layers. These bands can spread if gentle turbulences affect them and the cloudlets can grow due to an increase in moisture within them which can cover the sun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If they grow and thicken they become CM7 due to the chaotic nature of three cloud types seen together in the sky. But if they thicken so much that it begins to rain then they transition into CM2 type, Nimbostratus clouds.

                      Where a temperature inversion is encountered, cumuliform clouds can begin to spread horizontally as opposed to growing vertically. They can be formed from a decaying Cumulonimbus cloud and can appear to be an anvil but would never be classified as one. The horizontal spreading can sometimes be temporary so that vertical growth can resume.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      These clouds are unlikely to produce and heavy precipitation, but if the clouds thicken you could expect to see a short, light shower.

                      You shouldn’t expect any rain with these three varieties of cloud, but they can be very persistent in covering the sun for long periods of time.

                      These clouds have a common altocumulus cotton wool appearance about their bases, but will sprout towers (Castellanus) or small cumuliform tufts (Floccus). These elements strongly suggest that there is some instability in the upper troposphere and they can be arranged in rows or whatever direction the wind is strongest. Some can look like small, ragged cumulus clouds with a trailing tail below them, which is rain/snow that doesn’t reach the ground, called virga.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you spot the Castellanus version of CM8 and the towers are growing then you can be sure that a thunderstorm will be brewing over the next 24 hours as the instability grows. If you spot the Floccus type then it is also likely you will get a storm brewing because they are closely associated with humid conditions which, through convection, grow into powerful Cumulonimbus clouds.

                    <h3>Altocumulus of a chaotic sky (CM9):</h3>
                    <p>
                      A sky classified as CM9 will have several layers of poorly formed sheets of altocumulus at different heights. Many will be broken up and well, rather chaotic as the name suggests!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      These skies can produce beautiful sunsets when the sun’s rays shine through different patches of cloud but they can sometimes mean rain is on its way. Overall it is difficult to predict exact weather conditions with these clouds because they are all in different transitional phases.
