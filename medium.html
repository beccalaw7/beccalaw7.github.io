                  This cloud covers most of the sky in a thin, grey, featureless blanket. It can form from a sinking CH5 cloud or from a Cumulonimbus cloud spreading out at the top. Optical phenomena known as coronas and irisation are associated with these clouds because of the uniform droplets being perfect for the suns (or moons) light to diffract around them, creating coloured rings or patches.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They are often associated with overcast skies, however, these clouds are a sign of an incoming warm front because they can result from the lifting of a warm air mass that comes ahead of a warm front. Unfortunately, if the warm air continues to push in, you will get rain soon (transition to CM2) because of the moisture being forced upwards.

                        These convective clouds are developments of CL1 clouds that have grown and gained a much stronger vertical extension. Here we start to see a cauliflower appearance to the growing clouds but by late afternoon-evening they will shrink as the rising thermals dissipate.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When formed over land, these clouds will likely disappear and you shouldn’t expect rainfall because their shrinking is due to temperature change as opposed to precipitation. However, when these clouds are formed over the sea they can continue to grow rapidly because the oceans cool much slower than the land meaning the CL2 clouds are ‘fed’ for longer and risk turning into CL3 or CL4 type!

                      For clouds to form the air needs to be saturated which means the relative humidity needs to be 100% and the air is holding as much moisture as it can hold. This means that any water vapour in the air can only condense back into liquid form which increases the concentration of water droplets in the air that can clump together into clouds. The warmer the air is, the more water vapour it can hold because temperature is a measure of the energy held by the gas molecules. A higher temperature means that the molecules move faster, they have a greater kinetic energy, but they don’t all travel at the same speeds. The graph on the left shows the variation of speeds for a specific temperature, the graph on the right shows how the whole graph gets shifted along when the temperature is raised which increases the average speed of molecules.

                      We know that water will evaporate faster from warmer water because the average kinetic energy of the molecules will be faster and therefore more able to ‘escape’ from the surface of the main body of water. We also know that when the molecules in the air cool or become slower they can condense back into liquid form. Imagine there is a lake of water that is in perfect equilibrium with the saturated air above it whereby water molecules going from liquid to gas (lake&rarr;air) is at the same rate as water molecules going from gas to liquid (air&rarr;lake). If you warm up the lake and the air above it, the equilibrium will be disrupted and more water molecules will be evaporating into the air above. So the warmer air will technically ‘hold’ more water vapour, because faster molecules from the centre of the pyramid bar graph are more likely to be in the gas state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, just having a large concentration of water vapour in the air (100% humidity) is not enough because the water vapour needs a non-gaseous surface to collide with in order for it to condense and transition from gas to liquid. These are tiny particles of dust, salt and other particles called Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) which are 1 micron in radius; water vapour is 0.0001 micron in radius, a magnitude of 4 difference which means if one water vapour molecule was a marble, it would want to condense onto a CCN surface equivalent to an Olympic swimming pool! Just to give you some perspective of how many CCN there are in the air, there are approximately 150,000 particles in a volume of air the same as your index finger. This is a vast amount, even though the air looks clean, and if there was a volcanic explosion or an increase in pollution being released into the atmosphere then this number would increase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Usually the atmosphere is very dry near the surface of the earth and gets gradually more saturated until the air is fully saturated at the condensation level, which is the height at which clouds begin to form. This level is often distinctive with cumulus clouds because their flat bases will be at this level.

                      Convection is the process of vertical air circulation that occurs when the ground is heated by the sun causing air masses in contact with the ground to rise. The incoming electromagnetic radiation from the sun is in the range of infrared through to ultraviolet (which includes visible light) in which some is absorbed by the earth’s atmosphere and some is re-emitted back into space. The rest reaches the earth’s surface and is absorbed and emitted which heats up the ground and the air above it. When air heats up it is said to expand; this isn’t strictly true and can be visualised best with a balloon as opposed to a rigid container.

                       If air molecules inside a balloon are heated they begin to move with a higher velocity because more heat energy is transferred to them and so more collisions occur between molecules as well as with the flexible sides of the balloon. This is seen macroscopically as the balloon expanding; hence the idea of warm air expanding appears. However, if you heated the air inside a rigid container the molecules would still move faster with the same heat energy as in the balloon, but the container wouldn’t be seen to expand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The hot air mass rises because the colder, denser air above sinks which forces the warmer, less dense air mass upwards. Imagine a light, not very dense ping pong ball and you push it to the bottom of a bucket of water. The ping pong ball will be forced to rise back to the surface by the dense mass of water exerting a buoyant force equal to the weight (mass x gravity) of the water displaced by the ping pong ball, according to Archimedes the Greek Mathematician.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So to complete the convection cell, when the warm air mass rises, the temperature decreases which causes it to reach its dew point where it cannot physically hold any more water vapour. This is one way clouds can form because their saturation point is reached. Another way the air can become saturated is through high levels of evaporation from the surface so that the air cannot hold any more water vapour. At this point clouds form. Cooler air surrounding the clouds sinks which forms the blue sky patches commonly seen between these fair weather clouds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Condensation releases more thermal energy, locked inside the water droplets, which encourages the clouds to grow taller as the convection cell continues; almost like a chain reaction! You can often see towers or domes’ forming as the cloud grows taller, but by late afternoon they will begin to shrink as the thermals diminish and this is dependent on the stability and temperature of the air.

                    <p>
                      These clouds are the next stage of development from a CL2 type cloud because they have a more distinct towering cauliflower appearance and will reach to the upper limits of the troposphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the Earth’s atmosphere where all weather occurs. The next layer is called the Stratosphere and the boundary between is called the Tropopause, whose height varies with seasons (winter=lower, summer=higher) and latitude (poles=lower, equator=higher) so it can be as high as 20km (65,000ft) at the equator in summer and as low as 7km (23,000ft) over the poles in winter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      These clouds have high energy and unfortunately for you if you’ve spotted one, high water content. These clouds can produce very heavy rain but often in short bursts so if you see some growing CL2 type clouds at lunchtime I would advise you take an umbrella if you’re heading out!

Rising thermals are not strong enough to punch through the temperature inversion so the cloud begins to spread horizontally, leaving some isolated patches of growing cumulus towers.

                      These clouds are the most common clouds on Earth and look like a blanket of cumulus clouds stretched across the sky and slightly broken up into clumps. They form when low sheets of stratus clouds break up due to upward convection and form thicker, darker rolls of clouds. Some parts of the clouds can form convective turrets in which case they would be stratocumulus castellanus clouds that could develop into CL2 clouds. Stratocumulus Lenticularis are a rare form of cloud that form when warm air is forced over hills and create long lenticular shapes. Stratocumulus stratiformis are a less continuous form of this cloud and blue sky can be seen between the small cotton wool clumps.

                    This is a very low level cloud that can obscure the tops of buildings with its large continuous sheet of water droplets in a uniform grey blanket. They form in cool, stable conditions and don’t rely on convection to form, like cumulus clouds do. They form when a cool air mass is blown over the cold sea or land which causes widespread low-level condensation (<500m).

                      If this cloud is lifting over hills then you could be expecting some rain to follow. However, if it has formed overnight and seems dull on your summer’s morning, often the sun will evaporate the droplets away leaving you with a lovely sunny day.

                      This is not a cloud to confuse with fog or mist because some would argue that these are not strictly clouds at all because of their direct contact with the surface and formation from the surface. There is a distinct difference between fog and mist which is useful to know and it is hidden in their definitions; FOG: 'Obscurity in the surface layers of the atmosphere, which is caused by a suspension of water droplets resulting visibility less than 1 km' MIST: 'when there is such obscurity and the associated visibility is equal to or exceeds 1 km'. This means that mist is a less dense version of fog and you can see further in it as only the slightest winds can clear it.

                      Technically fog is just a cloud that formed at ground level because they share the same properties. Radiation fog is common on clear stable winter nights when the ground cools down and the air above the ground cools too. This causes the air to reach its dew point because it becomes cooled to a point where it cannot hold any more moisture so it condenses out to form fog. This type of fog often clears quickly when the sun heats the ground and evaporates the droplets away.

                      Very low clouds that can be separate or in one merged layer and will usually remain in the form of fast moving wisps just ahead of rain clouds.

                    <p>
                      These clouds themselves do not produce any rain but they are known as messenger clouds because they come just ahead of rain clouds like CL2.

                    <h3>Cumulus and Stratocumulus at different heights (CL8):</h3>
                    <p>
                      These are small, convective clouds that form about 300m (1000ft) beneath an already present stratocumulus layer at 900m (3000ft) and instead of spreading horizontally as before, they thrust through the layer. As this happens the upper stratocumulus layer can begin to break up due to the contact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The lower layer of cumulus clouds is unlikely to produce any rain but if the upper stratocumulus layer thickens and becomes darker then you could expect rain soon. These are clouds to keep an eye on because of the sheer uncertainty around them.

                    <h3>Cumulonimbus Capillatus (CL9):</h3>
                    <p>
                      There is a reason that to feel on top of the world is called being on cloud nine, and that is because the almighty Cumulonimbus (CL9) cloud can stretch from around 600m (2000ft) to 18km (60,000ft) or more which is where the troposphere meets the stratosphere, making them the tallest structures on (sort of) Earth. They are very powerful thunderclouds that contain as much energy as ten Hiroshima-sized atom bombs and can be recognised by their towering cauliflower bulges and ice crystal anvil top from the strong convection currents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Single cell cumulonimbus clouds will produce short lived (1 hour) heavy rain, thunder, lightning, hail and strong winds. Multiple cells can coalesce and form giant structures that precipitate for hours/days and these storm systems are responsible for tornadoes too.

                      Cumulonimbus clouds form when there are strong convective currents and updraughts of thermals that allow the cloud to grow in size and energy as more is released through condensation. Lightning is one of the most exciting phenomena to come from these clouds and it begins with polarisation; the separation of opposite charges. The powerful updraughts of air cause collisions of water droplets which separate electrons from their proton-neutron nucleus leading to an excess of positive charges congregating at the top of the cloud and an excess of negative charges near the base of the cloud. Another mechanism that causes polarisation to occur is through freezing. Droplets freeze within the cloud when they reach a certain height and the temperature cools to around -30°C and they become negatively charged. These are then surrounded by positively charged water droplets that haven’t yet been frozen but can be easily moved with updraughts because they are less dense. Therefore the positive droplets get carried to the top of the cloud and the negatively charged ice droplets sink to the bottom. As you can imagine, this mechanism is continuous and droplets are always moving around within the cloud; this is the same mechanism that forms hail stones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A movement of electrons to Earth’s surface is induced by the cloud’s electric field and electrons on the Earth’s outer surface are repelled by the negatively charged cloud base which creates a positive charge on Earth’s surface below the cloud. This is a build-up of static charge which increases as the electric field increases and eventually a cluster of electrons want to be discharged from the cloud base. The air is an insulator under normal conditions but the electric fields of the cloud are capable of ionising the air around it and so the air becomes a conductive plasma of free electrons and positive ions. This allows the cluster of electrons to zig-zag down to Earth via the conductive plasma at around 60 miles per second (very very fast). This cluster isn’t the actual lightning strike, but the step leader which begins the journey to the earth due to the conductive plasma and the clouds electric field. A purple glow is seen here from the ionised air molecules.

                    <p>
                      The lightning bolt follows when the positive charge builds up more on the Earth’s surface from further movement of electrons and the formation of a streamer as the positive charge migrates upwards to meet the step leader. On meeting, they complete the path for lightning which is a surge of electrons that travel at 50,000 miles per second (very very very very very fast). The flash we observe is from the return stroke that is a surge of electrons racing upwards to the cloud. The lightning strike heats the air to 30,000°C which generates a shockwave, through the rapid expansion of air, which we hear as thunder.
