                    These are convective clouds which will resemble small puffs of cotton wool with very little vertical extension on them. They form when the ground or ocean is heated by the sun which in turn heats the air mass just above it and as the air rises in columns it cools and condenses, forming cumulus clouds.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They often form on clear mornings when the sun has been able to heat the ground. Don’t worry about rain until they grow into CL2 type, but not all do.

                      <p>
                        These convective clouds are developments of CL1 clouds that have grown and gained a much stronger vertical extension. Here we start to see a cauliflower appearance to the growing clouds but by late afternoon-evening they will shrink as the rising thermals dissipate.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When formed over land, these clouds will likely disappear and you shouldn’t expect rainfall because their shrinking is due to temperature change as opposed to precipitation. However, when these clouds are formed over the sea they can continue to grow rapidly because the oceans cool much slower than the land meaning the CL2 clouds are ‘fed’ for longer and risk turning into CL3 or CL4 type!

                      For clouds to form the air needs to be saturated which means the relative humidity needs to be 100% and the air is holding as much moisture as it can hold. This means that any water vapour in the air can only condense back into liquid form which increases the concentration of water droplets in the air that can clump together into clouds. The warmer the air is, the more water vapour it can hold because temperature is a measure of the energy held by the gas molecules. A higher temperature means that the molecules move faster, they have a greater kinetic energy, but they don’t all travel at the same speeds. The graph on the left shows the variation of speeds for a specific temperature, the graph on the right shows how the whole graph gets shifted along when the temperature is raised which increases the average speed of molecules.

                      We know that water will evaporate faster from warmer water because the average kinetic energy of the molecules will be faster and therefore more able to ‘escape’ from the surface of the main body of water. We also know that when the molecules in the air cool or become slower they can condense back into liquid form. Imagine there is a lake of water that is in perfect equilibrium with the saturated air above it whereby water molecules going from liquid to gas (lakeair) is at the same rate as water molecules going from gas to liquid (airlake). If you warm up the lake and the air above it, the equilibrium will be disrupted and more water molecules will be evaporating into the air above. So the warmer air will technically ‘hold’ more water vapour, because faster molecules from the centre of the pyramid bar graph are more likely to be in the gas state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, just having a large concentration of water vapour in the air (100% humidity) is not enough because the water vapour needs a non-gaseous surface to collide with in order for it to condense and transition from gas to liquid. These are tiny particles of dust, salt and other particles called Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) which are 1 micron in radius; water vapour is 0.0001 micron in radius, a magnitude of 4 difference which means if one water vapour molecule was a marble, it would want to condense onto a CCN surface equivalent to an Olympic swimming pool! Just to give you some perspective of how many CCN there are in the air, there are approximately 150,000 particles in a volume of air the same as your index finger. This is a vast amount, even though the air looks clean, and if there was a volcanic explosion or an increase in pollution being released into the atmosphere then this number would increase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Usually the atmosphere is very dry near the surface of the earth and gets gradually more saturated until the air is fully saturated at the condensation level, which is the height at which clouds begin to form. This level is often distinctive with cumulus clouds because their flat bases will be at this level.

                      Convection is the process of vertical air circulation that occurs when the ground is heated by the sun causing air masses in contact with the ground to rise. The incoming electromagnetic radiation from the sun is in the range of infrared through to ultraviolet (which includes visible light) in which some is absorbed by the earth’s atmosphere and some is re-emitted back into space. The rest reaches the earth’s surface and is absorbed and emitted which heats up the ground and the air above it. When air heats up it is said to expand; this isn’t strictly true and can be visualised best with a balloon as opposed to a rigid container.

                       If air molecules inside a balloon are heated they begin to move with a higher velocity because more heat energy is transferred to them and so more collisions occur between molecules as well as with the flexible sides of the balloon. This is seen macroscopically as the balloon expanding; hence the idea of warm air expanding appears. However, if you heated the air inside a rigid container the molecules would still move faster with the same heat energy as in the balloon, but the container wouldn’t be seen to expand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The hot air mass rises because the colder, denser air above sinks which forces the warmer, less dense air mass upwards. Imagine a light, not very dense ping pong ball and you push it to the bottom of a bucket of water. The ping pong ball will be forced to rise back to the surface by the dense mass of water exerting a buoyant force equal to the weight (mass x gravity) of the water displaced by the ping pong ball, according to Archimedes the Greek Mathematician.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So to complete the convection cell, when the warm air mass rises, the temperature decreases which causes it to reach its dew point where it cannot physically hold any more water vapour. This is one way clouds can form because their saturation point is reached. Another way the air can become saturated is through high levels of evaporation from the surface so that the air cannot hold any more water vapour. At this point clouds form. Cooler air surrounding the clouds sinks which forms the blue sky patches commonly seen between these fair weather clouds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Condensation releases more thermal energy, locked inside the water droplets, which encourages the clouds to grow taller as the convection cell continues; almost like a chain reaction! You can often see towers or domes’ forming as the cloud grows taller, but by late afternoon they will begin to shrink as the thermals diminish and this is dependent on the stability and temperature of the air.
